# Project02
This is the second project for the Quickstart bootcamp. This is a search engine that allows users to look up Gifs using the GIPHY API.

The main page allows users to search a keyword that plugs into the GIPHY API

The main page also includes a dropdown menu that allows the user to select how many gifs they would like to see on their page.

Technologies used (.html, .css, .scss, .js, .jquery)

Ideas for future improvement:
1. Allow users to be able to select a specific gif to copy and paste to their clipboard
2. Allow users to click a specific gif that expands the size of it
3. Allow users to share their gifs through text or email
